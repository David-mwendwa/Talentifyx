/**
 * Rasterises scripts/og-card.svg into public/og.jpg — the 1200x630 image every
 * unfurler renders when a Talentifyx link is shared.
 *
 * There was no such image before, and no og:image tag at all — index.html
 * carried a title and a description and nothing else, so every shared link
 * unfurled as a bare URL.
 *
 * JPEG rather than PNG: the card is mostly large soft gradients, which is
 * PNG's worst case and JPEG's best.
 *
 * The step that matters is the font inlining. A rasteriser cannot fetch a
 * webfont — true of a *linked* font, false of an embedded one. QuickLook
 * renders through WebKit, which honours an @font-face whose src is a base64
 * woff2 in the document itself, so the faces are read off disk and injected
 * here and the card is set in the same Montserrat and Raleway as the site.
 *
 * They are injected rather than pasted into the SVG because the base64 runs to
 * ~100KB, which would bury the artwork anyone editing this needs to read. The
 * SVG keeps a single empty <style id="fonts" /> element as the seam.
 *
 * The subsets are latin-only, matching public/fonts/fonts.css. The card's copy
 * is ASCII apart from the em dash, which is inside the range — but a glyph
 * outside the subset falls back silently, so look at the image after changing
 * the wording.
