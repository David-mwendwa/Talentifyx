// Checks that the prerendered pages are real, and that the app adopts them.
//
// Two different things can go wrong here and neither is visible in a browser:
//
//   1. The static HTML comes out empty — renderToString instead of onAllReady,
//      a provider that gates its children on an effect, or a render-time crash.
//      The page still looks perfect a moment later when React mounts, and is
//      worthless to every crawler and unfurler.
//   2. The HTML is right but React throws it away on hydration and rebuilds
//      it, because the route's lazy chunk was not ready and Suspense rendered
//      a fallback against a full page of markup. The result still looks
//      correct, and is the entire cost of prerendering with none of the
//      benefit.
//
// scripts/verify-build.mjs covers the first from the files on disk. This
// covers the second, which needs a real browser.
//
// It serves dist/ itself rather than using `vite preview`, because the two
// disagree about exactly the thing being tested: preview answers
// /about with the SPA shell, while Netlify answers it with
// how-it-works/index.html. Testing against preview would hydrate the home
// page's markup into the how-it-works route and report the resulting mismatch
// as a bug in the app.
//
// The API is not running during this test, so every page settles into its
// empty or error state. That is deliberate — hydration happens before those
// effects resolve, so the check is unaffected, and it keeps the test from
// depending on a database.
//
// Needs a production build:
//   npm run build && node tests/prerender.test.mjs
